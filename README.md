# The Tech Academy Unity Projects
 This Repository is for all my submissions for Unity for The Tech Academy
# Submissions
welcome to my GitHub! Here are some projects I worked on while learning Unity and C#

## Project 1: ðŸŽ®[Coins Gone Wild](https://github.com/Dev-OtedGamer/The-Tech-Academy-Unity-Projects/blob/main/Coins%20Gone%20Wild%203D/Assets/Scripts/Player.cs)
**Description:** Here I created a game for my final submission for the Unity and C# course. I Created a playable character that can jump that is controlled with the players input. 
The object of the game is to collect all the coins. This was a timed challenge to design and create a playable demo.

## Project 2: ðŸŽ®[Star System](https://github.com/Dev-OtedGamer/The-Tech-Academy-Unity-Projects/blob/main/Star%20System/Assets/Scripts/RotateAround.cs)
**Description:** Here I created a small Star System, A planet revolves around a star and a moon revovles around the planet. I learned to use the lighting system in Unity to ulminate the star and create the shadow effect that is created by the revolving planet and moon.
I created a start button using C# that ueses the scene manager to load the start scene.
