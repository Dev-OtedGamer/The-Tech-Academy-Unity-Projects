# ðŸŒŸThe Tech Academy Unity Projects
 This repository contains all of my Unity with C# project submissions completed during my time at The Tech Academy.
# ðŸ§  What You'll Find
These projects demonstrate my understanding of core Unity concepts, C# scripting, physics, lighting, animation, input handling, and scene management.

## ðŸŽ®Project 1: [Coins Gone Wild](https://github.com/Dev-OtedGamer/The-Tech-Academy-Unity-Projects/blob/main/Coins%20Gone%20Wild%203D/Assets/Scripts/Player.cs)
**Description:**
This was my final project for the Unity and C# course. I developed a simple coin collection game where the player controls a character 
that can jump and move based on user input. The goal is to collect all the coins in the scene. This was a timed challenge designed to test rapid 
prototyping and gameplay functionality.

## ðŸŒŒProject 2: [Star System](https://github.com/Dev-OtedGamer/The-Tech-Academy-Unity-Projects/blob/main/Star%20System/Assets/Scripts/RotateAround.cs)
**Description:**
In this project, I created a miniature star system simulation. A planet orbits around a star, and a moon orbits around the planet. 
I implemented dynamic lighting to illuminate the star and cast realistic shadows as objects revolve. 
I also created a start button using Unityâ€™s UI system and C# scripting, which uses the Scene Manager to transition between scenes.
